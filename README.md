# Standard-Library
Custom C++ Standard Template Library (STL) implementation created for learning purposes. This project re-implements core STL components and other similar data structures, algorithms, containers, iterators, etc. from scratch to better understand their design, complexity, and underlying mechanisms.


## Note on Coding Style and Testing

Coding style and conventions may vary across files, since I am experimenting with different approaches as I learn.  

All **production code** in this repository (e.g., `DynamicArray` and other containers) is written by me.  
The only exception is the **testing code in `main.c`**, which may include snippets generated with the help of ChatGPT and serves only as temporary test scaffolding.
